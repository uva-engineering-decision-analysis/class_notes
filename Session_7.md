## The Cloud Hunter's Problem

There were clients here who were atmosphoric scientists. They had limited budget, which is the flight hours. In order to collect data, they have to fly a plane into the certain type of the clouds. In this application they were looking for the boundry layers. They were looking for particular atmosphoric conditions and they have to make their decisions about when and where they wanted to make their plane fly. They do not know in advance that where or not they are going to get the conditions that they are looking for that are suitable for data collection for the kinds of the program they had in their mind. 

To solve this problem, traditionally the decision making process features a lot of atmosphoric scientists sitting arround the table and looking at the maps of the forcasts and argueing with each other. In that situation, they got tons of the forcasts and discuss it with each other. they may not have done a bad job about figuring out what is the probability of the having good weather tommorrow. However, they may not have been good at 
figuring out what is the opportunity cost of using up some of the flight hours from the budget. They may risk and  used up the flight in the bad condithions and there is some cost in terms of less optionality to take

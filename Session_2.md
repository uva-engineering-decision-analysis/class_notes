# Session 2:

## Notations

x: Random variables     $x \in X$

Example: X={Infection is bacterial, infection is viral}={0,1}

$\theta$: Parameters, ounobserved. It describes our knowledge or beliefs about probabilitys of different x.

$\theta= prob{X=1} $

Example: $\theta=[0,1]$

$\pi(\theta)$ represents our knowledge our belief about $\theta$

$\pi(\theta)$: Somme probability distribution over $\theta$

$\Theta$: Parameter space


## Example:

x \in X={0,1} corresponding to whether or not the petient has or does not have a bacterial infection as oppose to viral.

 $\theta=[0,1]$  represents prob{x=1}
 
 Actions={Giving the medication to the petient or not}

Let present the same payoff in decision tree. We represent the decision problem imaginig you are going from lef to right, and as you go you are making choices.

In the case of the meditation problem. Suppose there is a free test and it gives you perfect information. 

Then, you always run the test and base on the result you choose the appropriate action. 

Suppose the test itself cost a specific amount of money.

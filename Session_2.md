## Notations

x: Random variables     $x \in X$

Example: X={Infection is bacterial, infection is viral}={0,1}

$\theta$: Parameters, ounobserved. It describes our knowledge or beliefs about probabilitys of different x.

$\theta= prob{X=1} $

Example: $\theta=[0,1]$

$\pi(\theta)$ represents our knowledge our belief about $\theta$

$\pi(\theta)$: Somme probability distribution over $\theta$

$\Theta$: Parameter space


## Example:






In the case of the meditation problem. Suppose there is a free test and it gives you perfect information. 

Then, you always run the test and base on the result you choose the appropriate action. 

Suppose the test itself cost a specific amount of money.

# Session 11


Example: We have the population of the fathers and sons and their occupation are divided into the five categories. The numbers in the table shows the joined probability distribution. Also, the sum of the all numbers in the table equals to one.

Two variables are independent if knowing one of them doen not give you information about the other one. Also, two variables are independent if the following relationship is trup between them:

$P(A\capB)=P(A)\timesP(B)$

What is the probability that the son is professional?

$Pr(Y_{2}=Professional)=\sigma Pr(Y_{2}=Professional,Y_{2}=i)=0.352	\neq0.164$

It is shown that the conditional probability is not equal to unconditional probability.

THe above concept is essentially what your predictive model is going to do. You are going to go from unconditional probability to conditional probability. You are going to condition on some data you have to give the probability of some future event. There are different way to create thiese joined probability events such as machine learning and so on. But essentially what you are going to do is to built somehow the joined probability distributions between the data that yu know about (Prior knowledge) and the data you want to know about.

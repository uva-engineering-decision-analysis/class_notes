# Session 3


Sometimes the actual decision problem was not very well articulated. In the decision problems there is always a cost or benefit and your goal is to find a trade off between them. So, when you are articulating the decision problem you are going to find what is the cost or benefit in the decision problem and what is the state variable space. The decision problems means the set of options that someone has to make. For example there is a fix budget for food and you are going to purchase nutrition and callories in order to maximize the quentify nutrition health benefits. 


## Formulization for statistical decision model:

Action set $\Rightarrow A={a_{0},a_{1},...,a_{m}} or A\subseteqR^{M}$

Example: you have a fixed budget and you got two assets including safe and risky assets. You are going to decide what proportion of your portfolio to put at the risky asset and how much put at the safe asset.

Ex 1:Portfolio allocation, 2 assets including safe and risky

Action: fraction of the portfolio in a risky asset

$0 \leq a \leq 1$    A=[0,1]

Ex 2:Portfolio allocation, 3 assets including cash,bonds,and stacks

Let $a_{i}$ fraction of portfolio allocated to asset i,i={1,2,3}

We must have 0 \leq a_{i} \leq 1, \sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i}=1$

$A={<a_{1},a_{2}, a_{3}>| 0 \leq a_{i} \leq 1 for i=1,2,3, \sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i}=1}$
